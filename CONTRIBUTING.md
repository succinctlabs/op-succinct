# Contributing to OP Succinct

Thanks for your interest in contributing to OP Succinct!

## Code of Conduct

The OP Succinct project adheres to the Rust Code of Conduct. This code of conduct describes the minimum behavior expected from all contributors.

## Ways to contribute
There are fundamentally three ways an individual can contribute:

1. By opening an issue: For example, if you believe that you have uncovered a bug in Reth, creating a new issue in the issue tracker is the way to report it.
2. By adding context: Providing additional context to existing issues, such as screenshots and code snippets to help resolve issues.
3. By resolving issues: Typically this is done in the form of either demonstrating that the issue reported is not a problem after all, or more often, by opening a pull request that fixes the underlying problem, in a concrete and reviewable manner.

Anybody can participate in any stage of contribution. We urge you to participate in the discussion around bugs and participate in reviewing PRs.

## Reporting Bugs

If you're experiencing an issue, please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/succinctlabs/op-succinct/issues).

## Contributions Related to Spelling and Grammar

At this time, we will not be accepting contributions that only fix spelling or grammatical errors in documentation, code or elsewhere.
