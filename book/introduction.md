# OP Succinct

*Documentation for OP Stack rollup operators and developers looking to upgrade to a Type-1 ZK rollup.*

## Overview

OP Succinct transforms any OP Stack rollup into a [fully type-1 ZK rollup](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html) using SP1. This means your rollup can benefit from the security of zero-knowledge proofs while maintaining compatibility with the OP Stack ecosystem.

### Key Benefits

- **1 hour finality** secured by ZKPs, a dramatic improvement over the 7-day withdrawal window of standard OP Stack rollups.
- **Unlimited customization** for rollup modifications in pure Rust and easy maintainability.
- **Cost-effective proving** with an average cost of proving only fractions of cent per transaction (with an expected 5-10x improvement by EOY), thanks to SP1's blazing fast performance.

## Getting Started

1. Check the [Prerequisites](./quick-start/prerequisites.md) to ensure your environment is ready
2. Run the [Cost Estimator](./quick-start/cost-estimator.md) to understand resource requirements
3. Try [OP Succinct in Mock Mode](./quick-start/mock.md) for development
4. Deploy [OP Succinct in Full Mode](./quick-start/full.md) for production

## Support and Community

All of this has been possible thanks to close collaboration with the core team at [OP Labs](https://www.oplabs.co/).
