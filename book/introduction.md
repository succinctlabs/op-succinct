# OP Succinct

*Documentation for OP Succinct users and developers.*

OP Succinct transforms any OP Stack rollup into a [fully type-1 ZK rollup](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html) using SP1. OP Succinct provides:

- **1 hour finality** secured by ZKPs, a dramatic improvement over the 7-day withdrawal window of standard OP Stack rollups.
- **Unlimited customization** for rollup modifications in pure Rust and easy maintainability.
- **Cost-effective proving** with an average cost of proving only fractions of cent per transaction (with an expected 5-10x improvement by EOY), thanks to SP1's blazing fast performance.

All of this has been possible thanks to close collaboration with the core team at [OP Labs](https://www.oplabs.co/).
