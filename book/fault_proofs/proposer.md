# Fault Proof Proposer

The fault proof proposer is a component responsible for creating and managing OP-Succinct fault dispute games on the L1 chain. It continuously monitors the L2 chain and creates new dispute games at regular intervals to ensure the validity of L2 state transitions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the proposer, ensure you have:

1. Rust toolchain installed (latest stable version)
2. Access to L1 and L2 network nodes
3. The DisputeGameFactory contract deployed (See [Deploy](./deploy.md))
4. Sufficient ETH balance for:
   - Transaction fees
   - Game bonds (configurable in the factory)
5. Required environment variables properly configured (see [Configuration](#configuration))

## Overview

The proposer performs several key functions:

1. **State Synchronization**: Maintains a cached view of the dispute DAG, anchor pointer, and canonical head used to schedule new work.
2. **Game Creation**: Proposes new games when the finalized L2 head advances past the configured interval.
3. **Game Defense**: Spawns proof-generation tasks for challenged games, reusing the same proving pipeline as fast finality mode when enabled.
4. **Game Resolution & Bonds**: Resolves games the proposer created or proved once eligible and claims credit from finalized wins before pruning them from the cache.

## Configuration

The proposer is configured through environment variables.

Create a `.env` file in the `fault-proof` directory with all required variables. This single file is used by:
- Docker Compose (for both variable substitution and runtime configuration)
- Direct binary execution (source it with `. .env` before running)

```

### Configuration Steps

1. Deploy the DisputeGameFactory contract following the [deployment guide](./deploy.md)
2. Copy the factory address from the deployment output
3. Create `.env` file with the above configuration
4. Ensure your account has sufficient ETH for bonds and gas

## Running

To run the proposer, from the fault-proof directory:
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin proposer
   ```

The proposer will run indefinitely, creating new games and optionally resolving them based on the configuration.

## Runtime Loop

`OPSuccinctProposer::run` wakes up every `FETCH_INTERVAL` seconds and performs four phases:

1. **State sync** – Reloads dispute games from the factory, tracks the anchor, and recomputes the canonical head using the cached `ProposerState`.
2. **Task cleanup** – Collects results from previously spawned tasks and updates metrics based on success or failure.
3. **Scheduling** – Starts new asynchronous jobs when capacity is available:
   - Game creation once the finalized L2 head surpasses the proposal interval
   - Challenged-game defenses, respecting `MAX_CONCURRENT_DEFENSE_TASKS`
   - Resolution of finished games and bond claims for finalized ones
4. **Task visibility** – Logs the number of active tasks per category so operators can see what work is in-flight.

All long-running work executes in dedicated Tokio tasks stored in a `TaskMap`, preventing duplicate submissions while allowing creation/defense/resolution/bond claiming to progress in parallel. Fast finality mode additionally enforces `FAST_FINALITY_PROVING_LIMIT` before spawning new fast finality proving tasks.

Metrics are published by a separate background collector that samples the canonical head, finalized head, and active proving task count.

## Features

### State Synchronization
- Incrementally loads new games from the factory using a cursor while verifying the output root and parent linkage.
- Refreshes cached status, proposal metadata, deadlines, and credit balances to flag games for resolution or bond claiming.
- Evicts finalized games with no remaining credit and prunes entire subtrees when a parent ends in `CHALLENGER_WINS`.
- Tracks the anchor game and recalculates the canonical head L2 block that drives proposal scheduling.

### Game Creation
- Schedules proposals once the finalized L2 head surpasses `canonical_head + PROPOSAL_INTERVAL_IN_BLOCKS`.
- Computes the expected output root locally and encodes the parent index into the factory call.
- Stakes the factory's initial bond and records the created game's address/index from emitted events.
- Automatically queues fast finality proving for new games when enabled, while gating concurrency via `FAST_FINALITY_PROVING_LIMIT`.
- Supports mock mode to gather proving stats without sending proof requests to the network prover (`MOCK_MODE=true`).

### Game Defense
- Scans cached games for `ProposalStatus::Challenged` entries that remain `IN_PROGRESS`.
- Spawns proof-generation tasks up to `MAX_CONCURRENT_DEFENSE_TASKS`, skipping games that already have an active proving job.
- Uses the same `prove_game` pipeline as fast finality mode, recording instruction cycles and SP1 gas when mock mode is enabled.
- Supports mock mode for testing without using the Succinct Prover Network (`MOCK_MODE=true`).

### Game Resolution
<<<<<<< HEAD
When enabled (`ENABLE_GAME_RESOLUTION=true`), the proposer:
- **Fast Finality**: Immediately resolves proven games (UnchallengedAndValidProofProvided or ChallengedAndValidProofProvided)
- Monitors unchallenged games
- Resolves games after their challenge period expires
- Respects parent-child game relationships in resolution
- Only resolves games whose parent games are already resolved

When enabled (`ENABLE_GAME_RESOLUTION=true`), the proposer:
- Monitors unchallenged games
- Resolves games after their challenge period expires
- Respects parent-child game relationships in resolution
- Only resolves games whose parent games are already resolved
=======
- Flags games for resolution when their proposal status is `Unchallenged` (deadline passed) or a valid proof has been submitted.
- Requires the parent dispute to be resolved and the proposer to be either the creator or prover before submitting a `resolve` transaction.
- Processes eligible games in batches via a dedicated async task and surfaces successes/failures through metrics.
>>>>>>> upstream/main

### Bond Claiming
- Flags games for bond claiming once the game registry reports them finalized and there is credit to claim.
- Submits `claimCredit` transactions for the proposer's address.
- Drops games from the cache after bonds are claimed.

### Chain Monitoring
- Recomputes the canonical head by scanning cached games. When an anchor game is present, only its descendants are eligible for canonical head.
- Queries the host/fetcher for the finalized L2 head to decide when creation tasks should trigger.

## Logging

The proposer emits structured `tracing` spans for each job type:
- `[[Proposing]]` wraps game creation attempts and logs `Game created successfully` on success.
- `[[Defending]]` drives challenged-game proving; completed proofs log `Game proven successfully` along with cycle/gas stats in mock mode.
- `[[Proving]]` marks the underlying proof pipeline, while `[[Proposer Resolving]]` and `[[Claiming Proposer Bonds]]` cover resolution and bond recovery.

Adjust verbosity with `RUST_LOG` as needed:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin proposer
```

## Error Handling

The proposer includes robust error handling for:
- RPC connection issues
- Transaction failures
- Contract interaction errors
- Invalid configurations

Errors are logged with appropriate context to aid in debugging.

## Architecture

The proposer is built around the `OPSuccinctProposer` struct which manages:
- Configuration state.
- Wallet management for transactions.
- Game creation, defense, and resolution logic.
- Chain monitoring and interval management.

Key components:
- `ProposerConfig`: Handles environment-based configuration.
- `sync_state`: Keeps the cached dispute DAG aligned with on-chain data (games, anchor, canonical head) and sets resolution/bond flags.
- `handle_completed_tasks`: Cleans up finished asynchronous jobs.
- `spawn_pending_operations`: Ensures there is at most one active task per category while respecting defense/proving concurrency limits.
- `handle_game_creation`: Builds new games once the finalized head crosses the proposal interval and optionally triggers fast finality proving.
- `resolve_games` / `claim_bonds`: Submit on-chain transactions for eligible games and trim settled entries from the cache.
- `run`: Orchestrates the periodic loop, delegating work to the task scheduler.

## Development

When developing or modifying the proposer:
1. Ensure all environment variables are properly set.
2. Test with a local L1/L2 setup first.
3. Monitor logs for proper operation.
4. Test game creation and resolution separately.
5. Verify proper handling of edge cases (network issues, invalid responses, etc.).
6. Test both normal and fast finality modes.
