# Experimental Features

This section covers experimental features for OP Succinct Lite.

## Celestia DA

The `op-succinct-lite-proposer-celestia` service monitors the state of an OP Stack chain with Celestia DA enabled, creates dispute games and requests proofs from the [Succinct Prover Network](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/network/introduction) and submits them to the L1.

For more information, see the [Celestia DA](./celestia.md) section.
