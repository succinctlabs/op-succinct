# Architecture

OP Succinct is also offered in "fault proof" mode, which is a good solution for chains that wish to have faster finality while not paying the ZK proving costs for every single block. The exact same OP Succinct ZK program is used for this mode--the only difference is the smart contrcts deployed onchain that integrate with OP Stack's `DisputeGameFactory` contract.

## Overview

We assume that the reader has a solid understanding of the OP Stack's `DisputeGameFactory` and `IDisputeGame` interface. Documentation can be found [here](https://specs.optimism.io/fault-proof/stage-one/dispute-game-interface.html). We implement the `IDisputeGame` interface with a ZK-enabled fault proof (using the OP Succinct SP1 program) instead of the standard interactive bisection game that the vanilla OP Stack uses.

## Core Concepts

1. **Proposals**: Each proposal represents a claimed state transition from a start L2 block to an end L2 block with a `startL2OutputRoot` and a `claimedL2OutputRoot` where the output root is a commitment to the entirety of L2 state.
2. **Challenges**: Participants can challenge proposals they believe are invalid.
3. **Proofs**: ZK proofs that verify the correctness of state transitions contained in proposals, anchored against an L1 block hash.
4. **Resolution**: Process of determining whether a proposal is valid or not.

## Dispute Game Implementation

Proposing new state roots goes through the regular flow of the `DisputeGameFactory` to the `OPSuccinctFaultDisputeGame` contract that implements the `IDisputeGame` interface. Each proposal contains a link to a previous parent proposal (unless it is the first proposal after initialization, in which case it stores the parent index as `uint32.max`), and includes a `l2BlockNumber` and claimed `l2OutputRoot`.

Once a proposal is published and a `OPSuccinctFaultDisputeGame` created, the dispute game can be in one of several states:

- **Unchallenged**: The initial state of a new proposal.
- **Challenged**: A proposal that has been challenged but not yet proven.
- **UnchallengedAndValidProofProvided**: A proposal that has been proven valid with a verified proof.
- **ChallengedAndValidProofProvided**: A challenged proposal that has been proven valid with a verified proof.
- **Resolved**: The final state after resolution, either `GameStatus.CHALLENGER_WINS` or `GameStatus.DEFENDER_WINS`.

Note that "challenging" a proposal does not require a proof--as we want challenges to be able to be submitted quickly, without waiting for proof generation delay. Once a challenge is submitted, then the proposal's "timeout" is set to `MAX_PROVE_DURATION` parameter that allows for an extended amount of time to generate a proof to prove that the original proposal is correct. If a proof of validity is not submitted by the deadline, then the proposal is assumed to be invalid and the challenger wins. If a valid proof is submitted by the deadline, then the original proposer wins the dispute. Note that if a parent game is resolved in favor of a challenger wining, then any child game will also be considered invalid.

**Illustrative Example**

    class A genesis
    class B defender_won
    class C challenger_won
    class D,E unchallenged
    class F proven
```

In this example, Proposal 3A would always resolve to `CHALLENGER_WON`, as its parent 2A has `CHALLENGER_WON`. Proposal 3B would resolve to `DEFENDER_WON` if and only if its parent 2B successfully is unchallenged past its deadline and the final status is `DEFENDER_WON`.

### Types

#### ProposalStatus

While `GameStatus` (IN_PROGRESS, DEFENDER_WINS, CHALLENGER_WINS) represents the final outcome of the game, we need `ProposalStatus` to:
1. allow proving for fast finality even if the proposal is unchallenged.
2. allow anyone to prove a proposal even the prover is not the proposer.

Represents the current state of a proposal in the dispute game:

```solidity
enum ProposalStatus {
    Unchallenged,                        // Initial state: New proposal without challenge
    Challenged,                          // Challenged by someone, awaiting proof
    UnchallengedAndValidProofProvided,   // Valid proof provided without any challenge
    ChallengedAndValidProofProvided,     // Valid proof provided after being challenged
    Resolved                             // Final state after game resolution
}
```

State Transitions:
- `Unchallenged` → 
  - `Challenged` (via `challenge()`)
  - `UnchallengedAndValidProofProvided` (via `prove()`)
  - `Resolved` (via `resolve()`)
- `Challenged` → 
  - `ChallengedAndValidProofProvided` (via `prove()`)
  - `Resolved` (via `resolve()`)
- `UnchallengedAndValidProofProvided` → `Resolved` (via `resolve()`)
- `ChallengedAndValidProofProvided` → `Resolved` (via `resolve()`)

#### ClaimData

Core data structure holding the state of a proposal:

```solidity
struct ClaimData {
    uint32 parentIndex;        // Reference to parent game (uint32.max for first game)
    address counteredBy;       // Address of challenger (address(0) if unchallenged)
    address prover;           // Address that provided valid proof (address(0) if unproven)
    Claim claim;              // The claimed L2 output root
    ProposalStatus status;    // Current status of the proposal
    Timestamp deadline;       // Time by which proof must be provided
}
```

Key differences from Optimism's implementation:
- `parentIndex` is initialized on `initialize()`.
- Simplified to single claim instead of array of claims.
- Removed `claimant` and `position` fields since there is no bisection.
- Removed `bond` field since bonds are stored in the game contract.
- Added `prover` field to enable anyone to prove a proposal even the prover is not the proposer.
- Added proposal status.
- Uses deadline instead of clock with period getters.

### Key Functions

### Initialization

```solidity
function initialize() external payable virtual
```

Initializes the dispute game with:

- Initial state of the game
  - `startingOutputRoot`: Starting point for verification
    - For first game: `GENESIS_L2_OUTPUT_ROOT` at `GENESIS_L2_BLOCK_NUMBER`
    - For subsequent games: Parent game's root claim and block number
  
  - `claimData`: Core game state
    - `parentIndex`: Reference to parent game (`uint32.max` for first game)
    - `counteredBy`: Initially `address(0)`
    - `prover`: Initially `address(0)`
    - `claim`: Proposer's claimed output root
    - `status`: Set to `ProposalStatus.Unchallenged`
    - `deadline`: Set to `block.timestamp + MAX_CHALLENGE_DURATION`

- Validation Rules
  - Parent Game (if not first game)
    - Must be same game type
    - Must not have been won by challenger
    - Root claim becomes starting output root
  
  - Output Root
    - Must be after starting block number
    - First game starts from genesis
    - Later games start from parent's output

- Bond Management
  - Proposer's bond enforced by factory
  - Held in contract until resolution

Initialization will revert if:
- Already initialized
- Invalid parent game
- Root claim at/before starting block
- Incorrect calldata size for `extraData`

### Challenge

```solidity
function challenge() external payable returns (ProposalStatus)
```

Allows participants to challenge a proposal by:

- Depositing the proof reward (the challenge bond)
- Setting the proposal deadline to be `+ provingTime` over the current timestamp
- Updating proposal state to `ProposalStatus.Challenged`

### Proving

```solidity
function prove(bytes calldata proofBytes) external returns (ProposalStatus)
```

Validates a proof for a proposal:

- Timing Requirements
  - Must be submitted before the proof deadline
  - Clock starts when game is created (for unchallenged proofs)
  - Clock starts when game is challenged (for challenged proofs)

- Proof Verification
  - Uses SP1 verifier to validate the aggregation proof against public inputs:
    - L1 head hash (from game creation)
    - Starting output root (from parent game or genesis)
    - Claimed output root
    - Claimed L2 block number
    - Rollup configuration hash
    - Range verification key commitment
  - Uses aggregation verification key to verify the proof

- State Updates
  - Records the prover's address in `claimData.prover`
  - Updates proposal status if the proof is valid:
    - `ProposalStatus.UnchallengedAndValidProofProvided` if there was no challenge
    - `ProposalStatus.ChallengedAndValidProofProvided` if there was a challenge

- Rewards
  - No immediate reward distribution
  - Proof reward is distributed in `resolve()`:
    - If challenged: prover receives the challenger's bond
    - If unchallenged: no reward but can have fast finality

Proving will revert if:
- Proof is not submitted before the deadline
- Proof is not valid
- If a prover tries to prove a game that has already been proven

### Resolution

```solidity
function resolve() external returns (GameStatus)
```

Resolves the game by:

- Checking parent game status. Ensures that the parent game is resolved and that the proposal is valid. If the proposal is invalid (aka `CHALLENGER_WON`), then set the current game status to `CHALLENGER_WON`.
- If the current game is in `UnchallengedAndValidProofProvided` or `ChallengedAndValidProofProvided` state, then set `DEFENDER_WON`.
- Ensure that the deadline has passed, and if the proposal is `Unchallenged`, then set `DEFENDER_WON`.
- Ensure that the deadline has passed, and if the proposal is `Challenged`, then set `CHALLENGER_WON`
- Distributing bonds based on outcome
    - Distribution result is stored in `mapping(address => uint256) public credit;`.
    - Actual distribution is done when appropriate recipient calls `claimCredit()`.
    - If parent game is `CHALLENGER_WON`, then the proposer's bond is distributed to the challenger.
      But if there was no challenge for the current game, then the proposer's bond is burned.

## Security Model

### Bond System

The contract implements a bond system to incentivize honest behavior:

1. **Proposal Bond**: Required to submit a proposal
2. **Proof Reward (Challenge Bond)**: Required to challenge a proposal, which is paid to successful provers

### Time Windows

Two key time windows ensure fair participation:

1. **Challenge Window**: Period during which proposals can be challenged
2. **Proving Window**: Time allowed for submitting proofs after a challenge

### Parent-Child Relationship

Proposals maintain a hierarchical relationship:

- Each proposal (except the first) has a parent
- Child proposals are only valid if their parent is valid
- Invalid parents automatically invalidate children
