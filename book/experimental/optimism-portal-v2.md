# OptimismPortalV2

If you want to use `OptimismPortalV2` or conform to Optimism's `IDisputeGame`, you can follow this section that describe how to deploy the 2 contracts:

* `OPSuccinctDisputeGame` a thin wrapper around `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle` that implements `IDisputeGame`.
* `OPSuccinctDisputeGameFactory` the proposer entry point when creating new dispute game.

And instructions about how to configure the proposer to use them.

After having done the step 2) either in mock or full mode, with `L2OO_ADDRESS` set with the address of the `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle` contract in your `.env` file,
run the following to deploy the contracts:

```shell
just deploy-dispute-game-factory
```
