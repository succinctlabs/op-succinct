# Upgrading `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle`

Similar to the `L2OutputOracle` contract, the `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle` is managed via an upgradeable proxy. The upgrade process is the same as the `L2OutputOracle` contract.

## 1. Decide on the target `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle` contract code

### (Recommanded) Using `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle` from a release

Check out the latest release of `op-succinct` from [here](https://github.com/succinctlabs/op-succinct/releases). You can always find the latest version of the `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle` on the latest release.

### Manual Changes to `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle`

If you want to manually upgrade the `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle` contract, follow these steps:

1. Make the relevant changes to the `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle` contract.

2. Then, manually bump the `initializerVersion` version in the `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle` contract. You will need to manually bump the `initializerVersion` version in the `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle` contract to keep track of the upgrade history.
  ```solidity
  // Original initializerVersion
  uint256 public constant initializerVersion = 1;
  ```

  ```solidity
  // Increment the initializerVersion to 2.
  uint256 public constant initializerVersion = 2;
  ```

## 2. Configure your environment

Ensure that you have the correct environment variables set in your environment file. See the [Configuration](./configuration.md) section for more information.

## 3. Upgrade the `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle` contract

Get the address of the existing `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle` contract. If you are upgrading with an EOA `ADMIN` key, you will execute the upgrade call with the `ADMIN` key. If you do not have the `ADMIN` key, the call below will output the raw calldata for the upgrade call, which can be executed by the "owner" in a separate context.

### Upgrading with an EOA `ADMIN` key

To update the `L2OutputOracle` implementation with an EOA `ADMIN` key, run the following command in `/contracts`.

```bash
just upgrade-oracle
```

### Upgrading with a non-EOA `ADMIN` key

If the owner of the `L2OutputOracle` is not an EOA (e.g. multisig, contract), set `EXECUTE_UPGRADE_CALL` to `false` in your `.env` file. This will output the raw calldata for the upgrade call, which can be executed by the owner in a separate context.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `EXECUTE_UPGRADE_CALL` | Set to `false` to output the raw calldata for the upgrade call. |

Then, run the following command in `/contracts`.

```bash
just upgrade-oracle
```

```shell
