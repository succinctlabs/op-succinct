# Proposer

The `op-succinct` service consists of two containers:
- [`op-succinct/succinct-proposer`](https://ghcr.io/succinctlabs/op-succinct/succinct-proposer): Receives proof requests from the `op-succinct/op-proposer`, generates the witness for the proof, and submits the proof to the Succinct Prover Network. Handles the communication with the [Succinct's Prover Network](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/generating-proofs/prover-network) to fetch the proof status and completed proof data.
- [`op-succinct/op-proposer`](https://ghcr.io/succinctlabs/op-succinct/op-proposer): Monitors L1 state to determine when to request a proof. Sends proof requests to the `op-succinct/succinct-proposer`. Once proofs have been generated for a sufficiently large range, aggregates range proofs into an aggregation proof. Submits the aggregation proof to the `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle` contract which includes the L2 state outputs.

We've packaged the `op-succinct` service in a docker compose file to make it easier to run.

# Prerequisites

## RPC Requirements

Confirm that your RPC's have all of the required endpoints. More details can be found in the [prerequisites](../quick-start/prerequisites.md#requirements) section.

## Hardware Requirements

We recommend the following hardware configuration for the `op-succinct` service containers:

Using the docker compose file:

- Full `op-succinct` service: 16 vCPUs, 64GB RAM.
- Mock `op-succinct` service: 32 vCPUs, 128GB RAM. Increased memory because the machine is executing the proofs locally.

Running as separate containers:

- [`op-succinct/succinct-proposer`](https://ghcr.io/succinctlabs/op-succinct/succinct-proposer):
    - Full `op-succinct` service: 16 vCPUs, 64GB RAM.
    - Mock `op-succinct` service: 32 vCPUs, 128GB RAM. Increased memory because the machine is executing the proofs locally.
- [`op-succinct/op-proposer`](https://ghcr.io/succinctlabs/op-succinct/op-proposer): 1 vCPU, 4GB RAM

For advanced configurations, depending on the number of concurrent requests you expect, you may need to increase the number of vCPUs and memory allocated to the `op-succinct-server` container.

# Environment Setup

If you are running the `op-succinct` service as a Docker Compose service, you should include *all* of the required environment variables in the `.env` file for both the `op-succinct/succinct-proposer` and `op-succinct/op-proposer` services.

Before starting the proposer, ensure you have deployed the L2 Output Oracle and have the address of the proxy contract ready. Follow the steps in the [Contract Configuration](../contracts/configuration.md) section.

## Required Environment Variables

| `L2_RPC` | L2 Execution Node (`op-geth`). |
| `L2_NODE_RPC` | L2 Rollup Node (`op-node`). |
| `NETWORK_PRIVATE_KEY` | Key for the Succinct Prover Network. Get access [here](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/generating-proofs/prover-network). |

### `op-succinct/op-proposer`

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `L1_RPC` | L1 Archive Node. |
| `L1_BEACON_RPC` | L1 Consensus (Beacon) Node. |
| `L2_RPC` | L2 Execution Node (`op-geth`). |
| `L2_NODE_RPC` | L2 Rollup Node (`op-node`). |
| `L2OO_ADDRESS` | Address of the `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle` contract. |
| `PRIVATE_KEY` | Private key for the account that will be posting output roots to L1. |

## Advanced Environment Variables

### `op-succinct/succinct-proposer`

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `NETWORK_RPC_URL` | Default: `https://rpc.production.succinct.xyz`. RPC URL for the Succinct Prover Network. |
| `RANGE_PROOF_STRATEGY` | Default: `reserved`. Set to `hosted` to use hosted proof strategy. |
| `AGG_PROOF_STRATEGY` | Default: `reserved`. Set to `hosted` to use hosted proof strategy. |

### `op-succinct/op-proposer`

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_PROOF_REQUESTS` | Default: `10`. The maximum number of concurrent proof requests to send to the `op-succinct-server`. |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_WITNESS_GEN` | Default: `5`. The maximum number of concurrent witness generation processes to run on the `op-succinct-server`. |
| `WITNESS_GEN_TIMEOUT` | Default: `1200`. The maximum time in seconds to spend generating a witness for `op-succinct-server`. |
| `MAX_BLOCK_RANGE_PER_SPAN_PROOF` | Default: `300`. The maximum number of blocks to include in each span proof. For chains with high throughput, you need to decrease this value. |
| `OP_SUCCINCT_MOCK` | Default: `false`. Set to `true` to run in mock proof mode. The `OPSuccinctL2OutputOracle` contract must be configured to use an `SP1MockVerifier`. |
| `OP_SUCCINCT_SERVER_URL` | Default: `http://op-succinct-server:3000`. The URL of the `op-succinct-server` service which the `op-succinct/op-proposer` will send proof requests to. |
| `METRICS_ENABLED` | Default: `true`. Set to `false` to disable metrics collection. |
| `METRICS_PORT` | Default: `7300`. The port to run the metrics server on. |
| `DB_PATH` | Default: `/usr/local/bin/dbdata`. The path to the database directory within the container. |
| `POLL_INTERVAL` | Default: `20s`. The interval at which the `op-succinct/op-proposer` service runs. |
| `USE_CACHED_DB` | Default: `false`. Set to `true` to use cached proofs from previous runs when restarting the service, avoiding regeneration of unused proofs. |

# Build the Proposer Service

Build the docker images for the `op-succinct/op-proposer` service.

```bash
docker compose build
```

# Run the Proposer

Now, launch both services in the background.

```bash
docker compose up
```

To see the logs of the `op-succinct-proposer` service, run:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

After a few minutes, you should see the `op-succinct/op-proposer` service start to generate range proofs. Once enough range proofs have been generated, they will be verified in an aggregate proof and submitted to the L1.

To stop the `op-succinct-proposer` service, run:

```bash
docker compose stop
```
